## Week 1
To start I read the work of Eduardo Perdices: "Study of Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras Framework".

After that i installed the SD-SLAM packages and run it using my own camera to test how it worked.

Finally, I started an Android application. As this work will use SD-SLAM + AR in a mobile environment, I started to create an application for Android that used C code (since SD-SLAM is written in C), adding OpenCV libraries that will probably be very helpful. In the video below, we can see the results of the final app, using the canny method through the OpenCV libraries.
